###How to Use
	use myLibconfig;

	new	myLibconfig($filename);

 >just parse to hash..no other.

 >i just learn perl for a moment,and the code is ugly but just run.


###Why Write This

1. cpan is terrible;it is hard to install,maybe it is a real ass compared to npm
2. also failed to compile the Conf::Libconfig,say need a lot of thing.and need libconfig.h..
3. because of need libconfig.h. i cannot only use the .pm file

###Unsafe and Not right enough

1. use eval so it is not safe
2. just support one array in every json
